        <h2 class="Question">1)I have tried one of your recipes but it did not turn out.What did i do wrong?</h2>
        Answer:Please understand that it is very hard for me to specifically answer this question since I am not in the kitchen with you. 
        That being said, I only share recipes that have been successful and well-tested in my own kitchen, but I understand that failures and mishaps can happen.
        Instead of blaming the recipe, it is important to remember that many factors are at play here that may result in a failed outcome. 
        But with a little bit more information, we can troubleshoot what went wrong to have a successful turnaround next time.    </div>

        Answer:Please understand that it is very difficult to give exact conversion information without further recipe testing. As always, please use your best 
        judgement to convert my recipes to utilize a slow cooker or IP.  </div>
